How to edit these fonts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The pcf files are binary compiled X fonts generated from bdf by bdftopcf utility.

The bdf fonts are plain text and could be edited by your favorite text editor
or by a bit cranky gbdfed editor.


How to use the fonts with xterm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Create the directory under /usr/share/fonts and copy the pcf files and fonts.dir there
* Add the fonts into X font directory (either in XOrg configuration or by xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/dir/)
* run xterm -fn -haxor-medium-12 (or any other name as defined in fonts.dir)
